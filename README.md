# GLOBAL-ENERGY-CONSUMPTION

![](Energy_.jfif)


## Introduction
The population of the World has doubled in the last 5 decades. From 3.3 billion in 1965, it rose to 7.7 billion ass of 2019. The implication is increased energy consumption. Unfortunately, the global energy mix which is dominated by fossil fuel has increasingly become an issue owing to the emission of environmentally damaging greenhouse gases. Sea level rise, seasonal changes and flooding have become prevalent in the last decade as a result of these emissions. To avert this, global temperatures must be limited to an average of 1.5-degree-Celsius above pre industrial levels. Emission reduction pledges aimed at halving greenhouse gas emsissions by 2030 were made by Nations at the UN Paris Conference in 2015. But, have Nations made adjustments in respect of these pledges?



## Problem Statement
- Has there been considerable progress in reducing global fossil fuel consumption?
- What is the current percentage of renewables in the energy mix?
- Which countries are the top consumers of fossil fuel and why so?
- Would all these pose a serious challenge to achieving net-zero?
